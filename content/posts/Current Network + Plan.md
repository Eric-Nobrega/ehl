### The current status of my home lab can be seen in the image below.

**Parts have been redacted for security purposes.**

![Test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eric-Nobrega/ehl/main/content/posts/images/topology.jpg)

I will be posting a guide on how to configure OPNsense, and then will dive into it's actual features. It is a very useful, free tool.

### Future Plan

I am in the process on setting up the rest of my lab, configuring x2 domain controllers (DNS, DHCP, etc), enabling AAD sync, etc. Once this is all up and running, I will be going over in future posts how to configure all of this.

I have also begun studying for my Cisco CCNA and my Fortinet FCPNS. I may make posts in regards to this, maybe going over more difficult concepts, or carrying out the labs.
