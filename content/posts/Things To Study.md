I've acquired some networking equipment, that I plan on using to improve my homelab environment.

**Current Environment**

![Test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eric-Nobrega/ehl/main/content/posts/images/topology.png)

This is my current homelab environment, note that it is in a very basic state. I also have an instance of active directory, a 365 tenant (AD synced).

I want to do the following (not in a specific order):
- VPNs
- Build Hosted Exchange Server
- Configure Firewall using User Objects, etc
- Build SharePoint Sites
- Small scale migration projects:
  - Single Tenant Hosted Exchange To 365
  - Remote Desktop to SharePoint + OneDrive
- Setup Domain Controller Redundancy
- Experiment with Logon Scripts & Batch Files
- Create Complex GPOs

**Certifications**

I currently have the following certifications:
- HND Computer Science
- MS-900
- AZ-900
- AZ-104
- NCA 6.5

I am studying for these certifications:
- CCNA 200-301
